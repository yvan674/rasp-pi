# rasp-pi

Rasp-pi is a small program I made to run on a Raspberry Pi with a 3.5" touchscreen display.
The purpose of the program is to show a clock when on standby and to provide shortcuts to use in Elite Dangerous.

Not much else to it really. 
Was more of a way for me to learn GUI programming using JavaFX than anything else.
